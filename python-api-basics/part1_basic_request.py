# --- EXERCISES ---
# Try these on your own:
#
# Exercise 1: Change the URL to fetch post number 5
#             Hint: Change /posts/1 to /posts/5

# Exercise 2: Fetch a list of all users

import requests

url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"

response = requests.get(url)

print("=== Fetch All Users ===\n")
print(f"URL: {url}")
print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
print("\nResponse Data:")
print(response.json())


#
# Exercise 3: What happens if you fetch a post that doesn't exist?
#             Try: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/999

import requests
